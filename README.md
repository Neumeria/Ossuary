# The Quiz-Hangman Game
Just a small project I worked on during my 4th Semester of college. It's a game I created that combines a quiz consisting of some of my favourite and handpicked general questions that I think everyone should know or just are cool facts worth knowing, and the famous game of Hangman. It's purely based on python and uses some of its built-in libraries to make a fun interactive session between the player(user) and the program itself.
Its not much but it's honest work. :D
