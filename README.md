# Welcome to the Ossuary wiki!
This is effectively my workshop where I test stuff out and/or just try to git gud at coding and website construction and pretty much anything and everything programming languages has to offer.
I mostly make small games and websites for now, but I'm hoping with time and more experience I'll be able to more than just this and increase my potential.
