*The Quiz-Hangman Game*

Hi everyone reading this!
I created this game during my 4th Semester of BCA as part of my Minor Project using only Python. As you might deduce from the name, it contains 2 games for you to play:
- The Quiz Game
- The Hangman Game

If you choose to download and play, I sincerely hope you enjoy ^.^

Pls note:- You will need the extra python extensions in the list to run the program as it uses some functions that belong to those extensions.

Pls Pls note:- You will notice there are 2 Quiz-Hangman Games (One is under "The Quiz-Hangman Game.py" and other is under the name "QHG.py").

- The "QHG.py" is the one that can run on its own on any IDE or terminal window (provided you have the extensions).

- The "Quiz-Hangman Game.py" is the one that is meant to run on a local hosted server (for which I personally used xampp.) hence, why it has some additional lines
of code and imports some additional functions such as tkinter.
