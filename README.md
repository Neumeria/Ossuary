Quiz-Hangman Game!

- "QuizHangmanGame.py" uses tkinter to allow user input via a separate tk window. If you prefer tk window, use this file.
- "QHG.py" is the more simpler one that uses the normal output window as it's place of execution. If you don't know which one you prefer or have no clue what "tk window" is, use this file instead.
- Required python extensions are already included, just make sure to download them along with the game and keep them in the same folder your game is in.
- That's it! Have fun! :D
